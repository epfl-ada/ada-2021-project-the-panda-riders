Are there any specific patterns we can observe across the years, for instance bigger coverage when there is the keynote ? Thousands of events occur around the world every day, and humans notice a small subset of these events. Yet, the media attract attention to specific events. In this regard, a companyâs media visibility will definitely affect its stock price. We investigate the reciprocal relationships between the fluctuations of the stock market of Apple and media coverage related to this company for a period of 12 years (2008â2020). "

Personality  plays  a huge  role  in  consumer  buying  behavior. Indeed, the high level of public attention and the positive emotional responses that define celebrity increase the economic opportunities available to a firm. We hypothesize that quotes from celebrities significantly impact the stock market, whereas quotes from ordinary people have no significant predictive power. One defining characteristic of a celebrity is that it is a social actor who attracts large-scale public attention : the greater the number of people who know of and pay attention to the actor, the greater the extent and value of that celebrity."

On the other hand, can it send a market into turmoil ? We hypothesize that emotions of the public in the media about a company would reflect in its stock price. Indeed, positive news about Apple would encourage people to invest in the stocks of the company. On the other hand, increases in expressions of anxiety, worry and fear would predict downward pressure on the stocks of the company. Understanding the author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. We classify quotes as positive, negative and neutral based on the sentiment present.
