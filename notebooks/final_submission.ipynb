The different quotes of our data set given by quotebank has more than one QID because the name of the speaker can be confusing with another speaker, so it gives the two QID in the list for that quote. To deal with this issue, we decided to use look at all the different QID for each quotes, and keep the label that corresponds to the speaker having the maximum number of total pageviews. The following cell show how the process is done over a sample the dataframe `quotes`. We do not do the whole filtering here because the run is about 22h, so wa done it once on multiple clusters and save it in a `.pkl` file."
