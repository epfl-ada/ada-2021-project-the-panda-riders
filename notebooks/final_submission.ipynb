The _ticker_ of the Apple stock is denoted _AAPL_, and we will first focus on a date range from 2010 up to 2020. We also provide an additional indicator of the daily volatility with the ``Liquidity`` field, which is the daily volume multiplied by the average daily stock price. This indicator in dollars is appropriate to have a quick overview on the quantity of Apple stock traded in a day, as a day of high liquidity is also said to be a day of high volatility. "
